```javascript
// next.config.js
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
experimental: {
appDir: true // Ensure App Router is correctly enabled
}
}

module.exports = nextConfig;
```

This ensures that the App Router is explicitly enabled, which solves many cryptic errors related to missing files and paths.  In some instances, additional configuration may be needed depending on the specific experimental features used.  The file structure should also adhere to the standard Next.js app directory conventions.
